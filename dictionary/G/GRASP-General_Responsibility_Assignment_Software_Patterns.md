# GRASP: General Responsibility Assignment Software Patterns

## Name

## Overview
- A set of 9 fundamental principles in object-oriented design (OOD) and responsibility assignment.
   - Controller: Assign the responsibility of dealing with system events to a non-UI class that represents the overall system or a use case scenario.
   - Creator
   - Indirection: Support low coupling and reuses potential between two elements by assigning the responsibility of mediation between them to an intermediate object.
   - Information expert: Assign the responsibility on the class with the most information required to fulfill it.
   - Low coupling: Lower dependency between the classes and change in one class having a lower impact on other classes.
   - High cohesion: The responsibilities of a given set of elements are strongly related and highly focused on a specific topic.
   - Polymorphism: Responsibility for defining the variation of behaviors based on type is assigned to the type for which this variation happens
   - Protected variations: Protect elements from the variations on other elements (objects, systems, subsystems) by wrapping the focus of instability with an interface and using polymorphism to create various implementations of this interface.
   - Pure fabrication: Create a service class that does not represent a concept in the problem domain.
