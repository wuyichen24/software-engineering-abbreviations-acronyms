# 3PC: Three-Phase Commit

## Name
- Three-Phase Commit

## Overview
- A distributed algorithm that coordinates all the processes that participate in a distributed atomic transaction on whether to commit or abort (roll back) the transaction by 3 phases.
- It is a more failure-resilient refinement of the two-phase commit protocol (2PC).
